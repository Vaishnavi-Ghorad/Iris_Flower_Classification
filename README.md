# Iris_Flower_Classification

Introduction

This project explores the fascinating world of machine learning through the lens of the Iris flower dataset, one of the most famous datasets used for classification tasks. Our objective is to build a predictive model capable of distinguishing between the three species of Iris flowers — setosa, versicolor, and virginica — based on the physical dimensions of their petals and sepals. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to uncover the patterns that define the uniqueness of each species.

Data Loading and Preprocessing

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named Iris (1).csv. The preprocessing steps involve removing the 'Id' column, as it does not contribute to the model's ability to learn the classification task. Additionally, the categorical 'Species' column is encoded into numerical form, enabling the machine learning algorithms to process the labels.
